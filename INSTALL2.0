# Open the Terminal and type this:
$ which -a brew

                    # typing 'echo $PATH' or email me

# Then install Git (hg). It lets you keep track of different versions of

# installed before Git can run properly.
$ brew install git

#make sure flask is installed for your current version of python, to test,
#open python and try typing `import flask`. There should be no errors when you
#do so.
