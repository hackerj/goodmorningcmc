Expenses
Hosting costs:
Currently hosting costs $8.50 per month, for a total of $102 per year.

Domain name registration:
We need to purchase goodmorninghmc.com and goodmorningpitzer.com. This will cost $9 per domain.

Email provider:
Next year, we are going to overrun the sending limit per month. Mailchimp charges $30 per month for lists of our size (works out to about $1.50 per day, to deliver 1000+ emails). Over 9 months of school, this will cost $270.

Snack SMS:
SMS costs 2 cents per user per text message. Multiplied by ~30 weeks, and 4 days of snack per week, this works out to $2.40 per user per year. Currently we have 100 users; assuming the list doubles as we add Pomona and other schools, this works out to $480 per year.

Stipend:
It takes about 1 hour to compose and schedule the email every night. I am asking for a year-long stipend of $500 for both members of Good Morning 5C. This works out to an hourly rate of about $6.50.

Scalability:
Fortunately, as we gain more subscribers to the daily email, our expenses don't rise much. Mailchimp will charge $30 per month up until we reach 2500 subscribers. If more users sign up for Snack SMS, our expenses will rise $2.40 per year per user. The time to compose the email, and thus the stipend, are roughly constant in the number of users who subscribe.

Revenue

Good Morning 5C charges for advertising space at the top of the email. The cost is $5 per day to advertise. Assuming 2 days of advertising per week (our current rate), we project revenue of $10 per week or $300.
