# First you're going to need Developer Tools for Mac - there are instructions
# online - you want to download XCode4 and then install it.

# On a mac you should try to install MacPorts - it lets you install all the
# tools really easily. http://macports.org and follow the instructions.

# After you've installed Macports, open the Terminal and type this:

$ which -a port
/opt/local/bin/port # if the 'which' command returns nothing you don't have
                    # Macports installed or it's not in your path. Try
                    # typing 'echo $PATH'

# Then install Mercurial (hg). It lets you keep track of different versions of
# the site. This will take a while as there are a lot of things that have to be
# installed before Mercurial can run properly.
$ sudo port install hg

# Install flask. Flask is a microframework used to display the pages on the
# site.
$ sudo port install python_select

# This one will take a while.
$ sudo port install python27

# If this doesn't work, try asking for help on http://stackoverflow.com.
$ sudo port select python python27

$ sudo port install py27-pip

# This should work, if not try typing `which pip` at the command line
$ sudo pip-2.7 install flask

#make sure flask is installed for your current version of python, to test,
#open python and try typing `import flask`. There should be no errors when you
#do so.

$ touch app.cfg

# create latest.html - copy any index.html file in "static", or when you run
# the server, it will complain.
$ cp -v static/cmc/february/5/index.html templates/latest.html

#finally run the DB
$ python run.py
